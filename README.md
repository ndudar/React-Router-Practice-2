# My Notes:
## Purpose:
I'm completing this project to practice React skills, specifically React Router.

## Notes:
### General:
- Routes allow you to have a Single Page Application

### Route:
- path specifies URL and element names component to render

### Link:
- allows you to load different components with **no refresh**

### Params:
- React built in Hook useParams() pulls the params as variables from the URL
- useParams() returns an object, the keys are the variable names according to the Route path and the values are determined from the URL
- you can have multiple params from a single path
```
/vans/:id/:type

{vans: {id: '2', type: 'rugged'}}
```

### Nested Routes:

#### Other Findings:
- Netlify is a good free and easy option for deplyment from GitHub
- Mirage JS (dependency here) acts as a mock server for api requests

Warning: Vite enforces using jsx syntax inside jsx/tsx files, so it will complain about that. Solution: rename `.js` files to `.jsx` :)
